system requirements:

python 3.5 or greater with:
 numpy
 pillow

openscad 2015.03-2

stl repair tool (I used netfab)

recomended OS: windows 7 64 bit or greater (linux may work but untested)


instructions:
install the above software before first use and edit the path in the python code to match your setup.
make sure to install the python libs!

tip: read "opt.txt" it has important info about the options.

tip: put all these files in a project folder

tip: use multi-thread openscad version: [http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/OpenSCAD-2018.05.30-x86-64_multithread-Installer.exe](http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/OpenSCAD-2018.05.30-x86-64_multithread-Installer.exe)

use:
1. adjust path at top of "main.py" (folders for output and preview created when run)
2. (optional) adjust the "bs" (lid sides) value in "make shells.scad"
3. (optional) adjust values in "opt.txt"
4. (optional) make a backup of "opt.txt" so you can reuse these values in the future.
5. open a python shell and run "main.py". (you may be able to just double click it)  
you will be prompted whether to use multi-threadding (if available) then nub count, a difficulty level and a shift mode value.  
shifting is where each row of the maze is shifted and wrapped for the illusion of a bigger maze.  
for shift mode 3, also input how much. it will be constrained by modulus, so large nums will not break it.  
stl's go in the "\stl's\" folder and previews in the "\prev\" folder.
5. the stl's may need repair. use a repair tool.  
it is recomended to view all stl's to check that they will work.

tip: preview the mazes in the "\prev\" folder. if using transition point, the one ending with "a" is of the same shell as without the "a".

6. print a 2-part test print at 0.2mm layers. if they fit, print the rest.

notes:
* it may take a while to run the openscad scripts. be patient.
* m=0.3 for 0.4mm nozzle worked well for me with ABS. PLA or PETG recomended as some shells can be large, nubs rub off easier with "soft" materials, and cheating can be possible with "flexible" materials.
* editing during the run may not be possible.
* openscad scripts run via shell in the python code. this speeds the process of stl export
	as this limits having to switch between apps.
* to make another or to adjust values, you will need to restart from step 2 as some parts may no longer fit.
